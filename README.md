This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## User Story

This app was to allow me to practice React + Redux, while making myself a mobile app to make it easier to follow my knitting patterns.

The basis for this counter was the Redux tutorial at (https://redux.js.org/) and then I added on another conditional counter for when I have various repeats in my patterns.

## Technologies

This app uses React Hooks, Redux, an SVG file from https://www.svgrepo.com/svg/227481/knitting-fabric, and a significant amount of copy/pasting and wondering if I should make 10PM coffee.

Version 1 was made in an evening. Version 2 would involve support for saving patterns and keeping track of multiple projects at once.
